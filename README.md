# SQL-Project-Calculating-Free-to-Paid-Conversion-Rate

**Introduction**
The project aims to estimate the fraction of students who purchased a subscription after starting a lecture, i.e., the free-to-paid conversion rate among students who have engaged with video content on the 365 platform.

Questions:
1.	What is the approximate free-to-paid conversion rate of students who have watched a lecture on the 365 platform?
2.	What is the approximate average duration between the registration date and when a student has watched a lecture for the first time (date of first-time engagement)?
3.	What is the approximate average duration between the date of first-time engagement and when a student purchases a subscription for the first time (date of first-time purchase)?
4.	How can we interpret these results, and what are their implications?
